📌 Project Overview
This project is a Chrome Extension that tracks the time spent by a user on different websites and analyzes productivity based on website categories. Websites are classified as productive, unproductive, or neutral, and the analytics are displayed through a user-friendly dashboard.
The extension helps users understand their browsing habits and improve productivity by providing clear insights into how time is spent online.
